This is the architecture ~~ROUGH~~ draft.
Written initially by Ethan Garnier, cannot use a .docx format due to being on a new machine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of architecture design is to make all the stakeholders understand what the system will do, how they are performed based on the use-case scenarios.

The first step is to give a general description of the system:
	- The system being developed is a University Registration Management System, "Studentable" (this name was created on the fly, up for debate). 
	- This system allows students of a university to browse a course catalog that provides information on various course offerings they need for the semester. 
	- Students will be restricted to only four course offerings per semester, with two alternatives incase other courses are cancelled or filled. 
	- This system detects when a course should be cancelled (less than three students), and when a course is full (more than 10 students).
	- The system will send the student's billing information to the university's billing system upon registration completion.
	- A special portal exists for professors through the management system which enables them to see which courses they are instructing, and who are the students enrolled. 
	- A strict grace period is enforced where students are permitted to change their schedule at the beginning of the semester. During this grace period there is a special student portal that only students have access to using their school credentials. In this portal they can add/drop courses. 
	- This system will be entirely web based, requiring no installation of software on university computers. It will be hosted on the university's public domain, therefore no need for the use of a VPN to access it from home or work. 
	- Students and proffessors will sign into the system using their student emails and self-appointed passwords. 
	- An admin account will exist for the university admin@university-domain.com. This account will allow the admin to perform customizations on the site. 
	- This system must be able to handle large traffic as in a worst case scenario: students, professors, and admins can all be accessing it.

The second step is to develop use case scenarios from different viewpoints. 
For this project the viewpoints are: student, admin, professor
